# Web Design Challenge

## OpenWeatherMap API Dashboard
The landing page has links to individual pages with in depth detail on each are of analysis (Temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, and humidity)<br />

## Landing Page contains:
An explanation of the project.<br />
Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.<br />

## Four visualization pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag.<br />
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.<br />
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.<br />

## A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.<br />
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.<br />
The grid is two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.<br />

## A "Data" page that:
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.<br />
The table must be a bootstrap table component.<br />
